# Deploying and Managing a Project with GitOps 

Now that we have the clusters defined, letâ€™s deploy a project which includes a service, namespace, and deployment.

This lab will use cluster1 only. The first step is to ensure that no resources currently exist in the *sample-app* namespace.
~~~sh
oc get deployment -n sample-app --context cluster1

No resources found.

<a id="markdown-deploy-the-application" name="deploy-the-application"></a>
## Deploy the application

The sample application we are using is an Apache web server serving a default index page.

The sample application includes the following resources:

-   A [Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) for the deployment and service.
-   A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) of Apache web server.
-   A [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

The [lab-4-assets](./lab-4-assets) contains definitions to deploy these resources.
For example: the [sample Apache deployment template](./lab-4-assets/deployment.yaml)

The assets will be loaded into Argo CD to be deployed and managed.

1. Change directory to `lab-4-assets` to see the assets to be created.

    ~~~sh
    cd ~/federation-dev/labs/lab-4-assets
    ~~~
2. Load the git repository and path into Argo CD

    ~~~sh
    argocd repo add https://github.com/openshift/federation-dev.git
    ~~~
3. Verify the repository has been loaded into Argo CD 

   ~~~sh
   argocd repo list
    ~~~
4. Create an application that uses the defined git repository

    ~~~sh
    argocd app create --project default --name rhte-simple-app --repo https://github.com/openshift/federation-dev.git --path labs/lab-4-assets --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc  --dest-namespace simple-app  --revision argocd
    ~~~
5. List the newly defined app. An important thing to notice is that the application will have a status of *OutOfSync*

    ~~~sh
    argocd app list
    ~~~
6. Force a sync of the application. This will provide a detail read out on the success of the deployment of objects. You should see a value of "Health Status: Healthy" and "Message: successfully synced (all tasks run)".

    ~~~sh
    argocd app sync rhte-simple-app
    ~~~

<a id="markdown-verify-that-the-application-is-running" name="verify-that-the-application-is-running"></a>
## Verify that the application is running

Verify that the various resources have been deployed. 

~~~sh
for resource in deployments services pods; do
    for cluster in cluster1 ; do
        echo ------------ ${cluster} ${resource} ------------
        oc --context=${cluster} -n simple-app get ${resource}
    done
done
~~~

~~~sh
  oc --context=cluster1 -n simple-app expose service httpd
  sleep 6 
  # Get the Route hostname
  url="http://$(oc --context=cluster1 -n simple-app get route httpd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
  # Access the route
  curl -I $url
done
~~~

<a id="markdown-state-recovery" name="state-recovery"></a>
## State Recovery

We are going to delete the deployment and watch as Argo CD will notice that the status is *unhealthy* and redeploy the deployment.

~~~sh
oc delete deployment httpd -n simple-app --context cluster1
~~~

As you can see the deployment is missing.
~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n simple-app get deployments
done
~~~

The deployment is missing so let's check to ensure Argo CD realizes the items are missing.

~~~sh
argocd app list
NAME             CLUSTER                         NAMESPACE   PROJECT  STATUS     HEALTH   SYNCPOLICY  CONDITIONS
rhte-simple-app  https://kubernetes.default.svc  simple-app  default  OutOfSync  Missing  <none>      <none>
~~~

Let's force a sync of the application to return the deployment. When runing the sync command notice that the item is missing.
~~~sh
argocd app sync rhte-simple-app
TIMESTAMP                  GROUP                     KIND   NAMESPACE                  NAME    STATUS    HEALTH        HOOK  MESSAGE
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00  route.openshift.io       Route  simple-app                 httpd  OutOfSync  Unknown              
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00                       Namespace                        simple-app    Synced   Unknown              
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00                         Service  simple-app                 httpd    Synced   Healthy              
2019-08-21T22:16:45-04:00   apps               Deployment  simple-app                 httpd  OutOfSync  Missing       
~~~

After running the sync command a FATAL error will appear. *FATA[0006] 1 resources require pruning* this is because the route 
we created within Argo CD is not stored within the git repo. If auto-pruning was on then the route would be automatically deleted.
~~~sh
for cluster in cluster1; do
    echo ------------ ${cluster} deployments ------------
    oc --context=${cluster} -n simple-app get deployments
done
~~~
